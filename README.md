Tunnel to the end

## Getting Started

This project is created using Flame and Flutter.  You will need that installed in order to compile and run the game

The game was created as part of the 2023 Game Jam by itch.io  https://itch.io/dashboard

The objective of the game is to keep the cat alive as long as possible as it slides its way down the tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that come along the way (ran out of time to get a good image for that).
To control the cat you can use the onscreen arrows or the same arrow keys on your keyboard.

The competition had a requirement of creating something that is related to hot and cold and for that there power ups and downs in the form of fire and ice respectively.

Also in terms of the constraint, the game interface does not have any text that gives any feedback

## What was not complete
* Image for obstacles are just placeholders
* Image for main character was meant to be a skater but could not find any where the skater was going away
* The game has not been tuned in terms of the physics
* The game has not been tuned for areas when hit zones become active as objects pass so that still feels a bit janky
* A whole load of niceties like flashing a colour around the border when powerups are collected
